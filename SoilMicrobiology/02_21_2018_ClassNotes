#  Microbial Biomass and activity

##  Bioremediation
-  Using microbes to clean up human messes
-  Difficult to culture
-  difficult to reintroduce to environment
-  

##  Microbial Biomass
-  amount of microbial biomass in the soil
-  undifferentiated whole or "black box"
-  microbes occupy pores < 10 micrometers
-  soil structure regulates predation
-  microbial biomass makes up <1% of soil mass

##  Microbial Diversity
-  Number of species or rRNA gene sequences
-  Life belongs to three domains
  -  bacteria
  -  archaea
  -  eucarya

##  Microbial activity
-  Rate at which microbially-mediated biochemical processes occur
-  Controlled by biotic and abiotic factors

##  Physiological Potential
-  Derived from *in vitro* measurements of
  -  specific enzymes
  -  rate processes
-  Answers:
  -  does the cell have the capability to...?
  -  Indirectly, if at all related to *in vivo* activities

##  Study of Microbes in Soils
-  Is it important?
  -  The study o microorganisms in nature represents one of the least developed and most poorly quantified areas of microbial research

##  Why is it difficult to study soil Microbes?
-  Difficult to culture
-  Conditions Change
-  Difficult to locate
-  Difficult to extract from soils

##  Measurement of Microbial biomass
-  Approaches:
  -  Cultural
  -  Microscopic
  -  Physiological
  -  Biochemical
  -  Molecular
