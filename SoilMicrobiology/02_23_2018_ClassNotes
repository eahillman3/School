##  Cultural Methods
-  Goal:  isolation of microorganisms
  -  selective media, culture conditions
  -  often requires enrichment
  -  only applicable to organisms which can be cultured
-  Dilution plating
  - onto agar media
    - nonselective or selective media
  -  Into liquid media
-  Every culture media is selective in some way or another

##  Quantitative?
-  Dilution plating
  -  requires dispersion and quantitative removal of cells from soil matix
    - stable aggregates?  biofilms?
  -  cells must remain viable and be culturable
  -  assumes each colony forming unit comes from a single cell
    -  often not the case.  Why?  cells stick together
  -  Unsuitable for mycelial organisms
    -  fungi, actinomycetes
  -  Favors sporulating organisms
    -  Bacillus, Arthrobacter, many fungi
-  Total counts < 1/10th of those obtained by direct microscopic counts

##  Microscopic Methods
-  Light microscopy
  -  bright field
  -  fluorescence
  -  phase contrast
    -  Don't have to fix and stain cells
  -  differential interference

##  Direct microscopic counts
-  Dilution series

##  Requires cellular stains
-  Simple stains
  -  Crystal violent, methylene blue
-  Selective stains
  -  gram stain, acid fast stains
-  Redox dyes
  -  Tetrazolium
-  Fluorescent stains
  -  Several stains available.  Some are used as vital stains
  -  Immunofluorescence uses fluorescent tagged antibodies
  -  Most commonly used for direct count:  acridine orange

##  Acridine orange
-  intercalates between DS DNA
  -  high RNA =  Green
  -  High DNA =  Red
-  Dye sensitive to conc, membrane properties, ratio of DNA/RNA

##  Other fluorescent stains
-  Fluorescein diacetate - Fungi
-  Fluorescein isothiocyanate - Bacteria

##  Advantages of microscopy
-  bacterial counts higher
-  stains to differentiate metabolically active cells
-  conjugate to antibodies
-  can see morphology
-  inexpensive

##  Disadvantages
-  requires dispersal of soil
-  highly subjective
-  cannot distinguish between genera or species of bacteria
-  cannot see small cells

##  Thin section microscopy
-  expensive but useful for seeing oil architecture
-  Optical light microscope (polarizing, fluorescence)
  -  resolution fn. of thickness of section
  -  excellent for *in situ* observation of soil matrix
-  Qualitative
  -  pattern of soil constituents - spatial arrangement of solid soil constituents and associated voids
    -  Size, shape, and abundance of aggregates, roots, plant residues and mineral grains and their relationship to one another
    -  Size, shape, abundance, orientation and continuity of pores
  -  Staining enhances biological material
    -  Fluorescent staining of 10 micrometer sections permits visualization of bacteria

##  Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

##  Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)

##  Microscopic Methods
-  Not used for biomass counts
-  used to look at architecture and morphology
