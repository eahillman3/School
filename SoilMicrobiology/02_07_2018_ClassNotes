#  Soil Microbe Phylogeny

##  Classification of life
- Tree of life

##  Simplified
-  Origin of life 3.8 B years ago
  -  tree being expanded by inclusion of unculturables

##  Cultured vs Unculturables
-  Classification is tricky

##  The prokaryotes
-  Bacteria and archaea

##  Bacterial Phylogeny
-  Proteobacteria:  alpha, beta, gamma, epsilon, delta, zeta
-  Acidobacteria
-  Actinobacteria

##  Taxonomic Rank from an Alaskan Soil
-  50% from Proteobacteria
-  15.3% from Acidobacteria
-  Dominant phyla appears to be consistent among most soils
  -  pH, temperature, etc. affect phyla arrangement
    - Main carbon source in soils comes from plants  (celluslose, lignin, etc.)

##  Bacterial diversity in Soil
-  Sequencing in soil
  -  Often throw away bottom 2% of soils which might be respondents to your experiment

##  Proteobacteria
-  gram-negative
-  diverse metabolism and metabolism
  -  *E. coli*, *Salmonella*, *Nitrosomonas*

##  Acidobacteria
-  discovered 1997
  -  acidic soils
-  30-50% of diversity in acidic soils
-  prefer carbon-poor habitats (oligotroph)

##  Bacteriodetes
-  gram-negative, rod shaped, non-spore forming
-  Degrade polymeric organic matter
  -  cellulose, chitin, starch, proteins etc.
-  Widely distributed
  -  soil sediments and sea water
  -  guts and on the skin of animals

##  Actinobacteria
-  diverse morphology

##  Firmicutes
-  medically important
-  Produce endospores
-  common in many environments

##  Archael Phylogeny
-  Extremophiles
-  Methanogens
