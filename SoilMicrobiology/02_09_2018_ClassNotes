#  Tree of Life:  Fungi

##  Tree of life:  Fungi
-  One of the largest Eukaryotic kingdom with an estimated 1.5-5 million species
-  diverse group with a wide variety of life cycles, metabolisms, morphologies, and ecologies

##  Largest fungus on earth
-  Entire fungus can't be metabolically active
  -  have hubs of metabolism and move energy/products throughout

##  Characteristics
-  Eukaryotic
-  Cell walls
  -  Chitin
  -  Polysaccharides
-  Spore or budding reproduction
-  Single celled or mycelial
-  30% of soil biomass

##  Lifestyles
-  Saprophytes
  -  obtain c from plant residues
  -  plant polymer degradation enzymes
    -  cellunases, ligninases
-  plant associated
  -  negative - plant pathogens
  -  positive - mycorrhizae
    -  obtain all c (arbuscular) or some (ecto) from plant hose
    -  return water and nutrients to the host
  -  Neutral or commensal
    -  plant endophytic Fungi

##  Fungal Phylogeny
-  its complicated and it sucks.

##  Yeasts
-  1500 species
-  budding
-  Ascomycetes and basidiomycetes
-  found world wide
-  economically important
-  pathogens of humans and animals
