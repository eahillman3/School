#  Biological control of plant pathogens-Theory and application

##  Enhancement of antagonists
-  Cropping systems to alter the soil microbial community
-  Continuous cropping of wheat to generate take all (*Gaumannomyces graminis*) suppressive soil

  ###  Take-all decline
  -  Disease starts at high levels.  Monocropping continues and microbial community builds up and produces antimicrobials
    -  *Pseudomonas* grows in wheat root lesions and suppress further growth
    -  Disruption of monocropping for one season, take-all disease reemerges

##  Planting specific cover crops
-  Apple replant Disease
  -  suppression of growth occurs due to nematodes and fungal species
-  Planting of wheat cover crop reduces effects of *Rhizoctonia solani*

##  Requirements for introduction of biological Biocontrol
-  High target specificity
  -  most antagonists generalists
  -  target-specific antagonists are very rare
-  Ability to survive and multiply in new environment afer single introduction and disperse to target
  -  many introduced plant pathogens are soilborne, not readily contracted by airborne antagonists

##  Application of introduction strategy to control a plant pathogen
-  Chestnut blight
  -  biocontrol:  fungus infesting virus

##  Hypovirulence
-  Chestnut blight hypovirulence can be spread via anastomosis
-  Slowed by vegetative compatability issues

#  Biological control of plant pathogens-Theory and application part 2

##  Augementation
-  Antagonist strains or communities are propogated
-  applied where needed
  -  innoculative - dependent on colonization of environment to which antagonists are applied and expression of biocontrol mechanisms by antagonists after application
  -  inundative - applied repeatedly when needed

##  US EPA regulates use of all pesticides
-  "Pesticide" = any product intended to control a pest, including biocontrol products
-  every pesticide must have EPA registration before sale or distribution
-  EPA issues registration based on independent tests for environmental safety, human/animal toxicity, pesticide fate

##  2 types of legal "biocontrol" products
1.  EPA-registered biopesticides
  -  intended for pest control
  -  can contain:  living organism only; living organism plus fermentation by-products; fermentation by-products only; or killed organism
2.  plant growth promoters-  no EPA-registration
  -  sold for plant growth enhancement
  -  biocontrol effect from stimulation of growth or alleviation of environmental stress
  -  growth promotion effect from antagonism, induced resistance against major and minor pathogens

##  Plant growth products that provide biocontrol
-  Compost
  -  hardwood bark compost used as potting medium fro woody ornamentals to control root rot fungi
  -  commercial composts from municipal wastes and sewage sludge used as top-dressing of turf to control fungal pathogens
  -  compost-tea made by steeping compost in water; sprayed on vegetable foliage to control foliar bacterial and fungal pathogens
    - not sold as products; risky practice; allowed in commercial organic production

##  Pros & Cons of using composts
-  Pros
  -  supplies microbial community with diverse ecological attributes and diverse mechanisms of pathogen inhibition
  - potential to address wide range of pathogens
  -  supplies nutrients to microbes and plants
-  Cons
  -  variability in organism populations of organisms due to differences in parent material, batches, and Age
  -  Risks from heavy metals and pesticide residues

##  Plant growth products that provide Biocontrol
-  Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria
  -  sold as:
    -  single strain seed treatment
    - microorganism mixes in liquid form
    -  Pro:  many products available
    -  Con:  much variability in effectiveness among products

  ###  Mycorrhizal fungi
    -  Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi primary type sold
      -  obligate symbionts
    -  Benefits
      -  protection against pathogens
        -  Induce resistance
        -  uptake of root exudates that would normally be exuded into soil and stimulation pathogens
        -  degradation of phytotoxins
        -  secretion of antibiotics
        -  sheath acts as physical barrier
      -  Limitations
        -  can only be propagated in pot culture with host plants
        -  products usually contain dried root pieces and growth media
        -  delivery is difficult
        -  high fertility applied to crop soils discourages infection by mycorrhizal fungi
        -  differences among strains as to host range and effects on hosts

##  

#  Apple replant disease question:  Does decline of older trees occur naturally or from activities of pathogens building up

#  Parasitic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi:  if they turn to parasitism, do they still form a sheath in high nutrient situations???
