##  Considerations
-  Which measure should be obtained
-  how often should you measure
-  how much sampling each time

##  Measure incidence or severity
-  when assessments made pre-30 days?
  -  Incidence
-  when assessments made post-40 days?
  -  Severity

##  Which measure of disease intensity should be obtained?
-  Depends on 3 things
  -  Pathosystem being studied:  incidence for systemic and soilborne diseases;  severity for non-systemic, above ground diseases (panama disease and wilt of palm:  incidence.  Mango malformation:  severity)
  -  Magnitude of disease intensity:  if intensity is high and over a wide area, incidence may be preferred to severity
  -  Objectives of the investigator:

##  Measurement levels and random variables
-  Measurement level
  -  Nominal level-  label assigned to each measure individual
    - diseased = D healthy = H
  -  Ordinal Level-  an ordered value is given to each measured individual
    -  Example 0 = no, 1 = slight, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe
  -  Interval measurements are ordered and differences between them have direct interpretation
    -  Temperature differences
  -  Ratio-  measurements are ordered and differences between them have direct interpretation;  in addition, there is a zero point or fixed origin
    -  30% disease severity is 3x as large as 10%

##  Random variables
-  discrete- all possible values are countable
  -  count variables-  ranges from 0 to infinity, although there is a theoretical upper limit
    -  number of lesions/number of spores
  -  Categorical variable
    -  Binary= as few as 2 categories
    -  More than 2 categories but no order=  Nominal
      -  species of phytophthora in soil
    -  If categories have order = ordered categorical
-  Continuous-  number of possible values not countable
  -  Differences between values can be directly interpreted
  -  analogous to interval and ratio level

##  Remote sensing and electronic assessment of disease severity
-  Spectral signature
  -  based on radiation off of canopy
-  Image analysis
  -  video or still camera is used to take a picture of a plant specimen

##  Indirect measurement of disease severity
-  root diseases:  measure senescence or wilting

##  Reliability and accuracy
-  reliability-  extent to which the measurements of individuals obtained under different conditions yield similar results
-  intra-rater reliability- agreement between measurements of a property taken repeatedly by the same rater
-  Inter-rater reliability-  agreement between measurements of a property among different raters
-  accuracy-  degree of closeness to measured values to a recognized standard or true value

##  Crop loss assessment
-  study of relationship between attack by harmful organisms and the resulting yield (or yield loss) of crops

## crop loss
-  reduction in quality
-  reduction in quantity
-  plant death
