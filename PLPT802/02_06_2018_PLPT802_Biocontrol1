##  definitions
- Biological control-use of natural enemies to reduce densities of pests or inhibit pest activities
- In plant path:  use of living organisms to manage disease

##  Biocontrol effects on disease development
- reduce pathogen numbers
- exclude or protect infection courts from pathogens (infection court=site of infection.  Stomate, wound, etc.)
- reduce symptom severity

##  Ecological basis for Biological control
- pathogens can be inhibited by "antagonists" (no viruses)
  - habitats contain microbial communities that have members that are antagonistic to plant pathogens
  - antagonists function as a 'negative feed-back' mechanisms

##  Evidence that biocontrol occurs in nature
- enhancement of disease in soils upon disruption of soil microbial communities
- disease, or pathogen, suppressive soils
  - soils in which particular pathogens are prevented from establishing; or if a pathogen is present, prevented from germinating and infecting
- evidence for biotic involvement:
  - elimination of suppressiveness by sterilization
  - transfer of suppressive effect to conducive soil by transfer of biotic components

##  Evidence that Biocontrol occurs in nature
- succession of fungi in wood
  - fungal succession:  fungi produce compounds that inhibit other fungi (strobilurins)

##  Antagonistic microbe-microbe interactions
- Resource competition (=preemptive utilization, preemptive exclusion)
  - one organism using up a limited resource before another can have access to it
- Antibiosis

##  What resources do microbes compete for?
- Nutrients (C, N)
- Minor elements
- Specific triggers for growth/reproduction
- space is not limiting
  - microbes coexist when other resources are available
- water is not limiting
  - at a microbe scale, microbial communities are either high and dry, and thus dormant, or bathed in a sea of water

##  Competition mechanisms
- competition for nutrients by way of rapid nutrient uptake and growth
  - E.G. prevention of fungal fruit rot using wound-colonizing bacteria

- Removal of a specific growth factor by uptake and preemptive utilization as a nutrient
  - inhibition of *Pithium ultimum* germination on seed surfaces by bacteria

- Removal of a specific growth factor by chemical sequestration
  - competition for iron by excretion of siderophores

##  Competition for iron via siderophores
- iron is in shore supply
- all microoganisms require ferric iron
- compete using siderophore affinities

##  Antibiosis
- mechanisms
  - lytic enzymes
  - antibiotics (toxins)
    - excreted antimicrobial secondary metabolites

##  Lytic enzymes
- serve in substrate conversion
- induced by substrate or digests of substrate
- effective antagonists produce multiple, potent enzymes, and are insensitive to their own enzymes
  - chitinases,Beta-glucanases
    - disrupt fungal cell wall structure
      - work synergistically
  - Proteases
    - important in lysis of bacteria and nematodes
  - Lipases
    - Disrupt cell membrane struture and function

##  antibiotics
- Antimicrobial secondary metabolites
  - produced by certain organisms against certain other organisms
  - produced only during part of growth cycle, usually when a particular nutrient becomes limiting

##  Competition vs antibiosis- effect on pathogens
- competition
- keeps soilborne pathogen resting structures in dormant state even when all other conditions are favorable (fungistasis)
  - temporarily halts growth of pathogens
    - no effect on pathogen viability or pathogen numbers
  - antibiosis
    - disrupts pathogen metabolism
    - disrupts pathogen structure
    - causes death of pathogen

##  Competition vs antibiosis- conditions
- competition more important when resources are limited or unstable over time
- antibiosis more important when resources are stable or higher in supply
  - production is nutrient/substrate dependent
  - antibiosis needed to displace existing competitors or to hold on to resources

##  Antibiosis is easy to see *in vitro* but its role in nature is difficult to prove

- *In vitro* conditions do not resemble conditions in nature
  - production of antibiotics and lytic enzymes in nature is site Specific
  - antibiotics and lytic enzymes are difficult to detect from natural substrata

##  Parasitism
- hyphae, spore and sclerotia are host structures
  - mycoparasitism (fungi on fungi)
- parasite must have direct contact with host
- chemicals (enzymes and toxins) are involved in different phases

##  Host mediated mechanisms
- systemic induction of host defenses
  - most beneficial organisms activate ISR, but many can activate SAR, or both

##  Host mediate mechanisms
- stimulation of plant growth/vigor via production of growth regulators
- Alleviation of environmental stress
- **Predisposition**:  plant being susceptible due to abiotic stress


##  Three approaches to biological Biocontrol
- conservation/enhancement
  - modify the environment or existing practices to protect and enhance population numbers and activity of existing natural enemies
- Introduction ("classical" biocontrol in entomology and weed science)
  - introduced natural enemy to control introduced pests
- augmentation
  - add native natural enemies to control native pest

##  conservation/enhancement
- make use of naturally-occuring communities comprised of diverse microorganisms including antagonists
- widely employed but generally not recognized as a form of "biological control"

##  Conservation of antagonists
- moderating use of pesticides and other biocidal treatments to preserve antagonists
- overlaps with enhancement- removes competitors of antagonists
- Use of mild heat treatments to pasteurize growth media
  - aerated steam treatment
  - solarization
  - aerobic composting of organic material
  - leaves populations of thermotolerant fungi and bacteria to recolonize treated soils

## enhancement
- addition of defined nutrients utilized by antagonists as nutrient substrate
- addition of organic matter to microbe-depleted soils
  - control of root rot of avocado caused by *Phytophythora cinnamomi*
