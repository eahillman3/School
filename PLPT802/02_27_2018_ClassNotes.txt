#  Modeling

##  Model
-  Simplified representation of the real world
-  approximations of what we think is happening

##  aspects of plant pathology commonly modeled:
-  disease progress
-  disease gradients
-  spore dispersal
-  spore germination
-  disease intensity-yield relationships
-  effects of environment on disease
-  disease forecasting

##  Regression modeling
-  e term is error

##  Two approaches to model development
-  Empirical-  developed using observed data;  doesn't take into account the theory or biological mechanisms underlying the process in question
-  Mechanistic-  developed by starting with a theory, hypothesis, or concept underlying the process in question;  takes into account the biological mechanism underlying the process in question

##  Coefficient of Variation
-  R^2 from 0-1, 1 being the best

##  Deciding on a model that best describes the data
-  Greater similarity between observed and predicted disease severity values

##  Mechanistic modeling


##  Simulation Modeling
-  simulate the process of a real world system
